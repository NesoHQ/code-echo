# 🚀 CodeEcho Roadmap

_"Let your code speak back."_

CodeEcho is evolving in clear stages. Each milestone adds new capabilities while keeping the CLI simple and reliable.

---

## ✅ Stage 1 – Core Scanning (COMPLETE)

**Status**: Completed

The foundation of CodeEcho with essential repository scanning capabilities.

- [x] CLI scaffold with Cobra
- [x] `scan` command to walk repositories
- [x] Output in `xml`, `json`, or `markdown` formats
- [x] Command-line flags: `--out`, `--format`, `--exclude-dirs`, `--include-exts`

---

## ✅ Stage 2 – Expanded Scanning & Polish (COMPLETE)

**Status**: Completed

Enhanced scanning with better file processing and improved user experience.

- [x] Rich file metadata (size, modified time, line count, language)
- [x] Repository tree view in Markdown + XML
- [x] `--no-content` flag for structure-only scans
- [x] Language detection with shebang and content analysis
- [x] Content processing options:
  - [x] `--compress-code` for whitespace removal
  - [x] `--remove-comments` with language-aware support
  - [x] `--remove-empty-lines` for cleaner output
- [x] Streaming architecture for memory efficiency
- [x] Intelligent binary/text file detection
- [x] Error resilience with graceful skipping
- [x] Progress tracking infrastructure

---

## ✅ Stage 3 – User Experience & Progress (COMPLETE)

**Status**: Completed

Significant improvements to CLI output and user feedback.

- [x] Verbose mode (`--verbose, -v`) with per-file progress
- [x] Quiet mode (`--quiet, -q`) for silent operation
- [x] Strict error mode (`--strict`) for CI/CD pipelines
- [x] Real-time progress bars with percentage and ETA
- [x] Comprehensive scan summary with:
  - [x] File statistics (total, text, binary)
  - [x] Language breakdown with percentages
  - [x] Error categorization and reporting
  - [x] Timing information
- [x] Code refactoring into smaller, testable components
- [x] Separation of concerns (Streaming vs Analysis scanners)
- [x] Error collection system for post-scan analysis

---

## ✅ Stage 4 – Documentation Generation (COMPLETE)

**Status**: Completed

Full-featured documentation generation from repository analysis.

- [x] `doc` command with three documentation types:
  - [x] `readme` - Project overview with tech stack and getting started
  - [x] `api` - API documentation for web projects
  - [x] `overview` - Project statistics and file distribution
- [x] Automatic dependency detection:
  - [x] Node.js (package.json)
  - [x] Go (go.mod)
  - [x] Docker (Dockerfile)
- [x] Getting started instructions auto-generation
- [x] Technology stack detection and listing
- [x] Project structure visualization
- [x] Key file identification
- [x] Directory analysis and statistics
- [x] Progress tracking for doc generation
- [x] Analysis scanner with full in-memory scanning
